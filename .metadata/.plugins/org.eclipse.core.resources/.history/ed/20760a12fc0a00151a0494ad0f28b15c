Import the PDCore and AndroidMidi folder as Module into your Android Studio Project
Set up the module :AndroidMidi as dependency for :PDCore  and :PDCore as dependency to your app (core) module.
Adjust the build.gradle of the :PDCore and :AndroidMidi modules. Update the buildToolsVersion and to the newest version.
Instead of compiling our project with the NDK, we have to add "jniLibs.srcDirs = ['src', 'libs']" to the PdCore build.gradle file.
